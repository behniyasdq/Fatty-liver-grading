EDA 

This folder contains the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) performed to evaluate the impact of data augmentation and ensure that the synthetic data closely resembles the original dataset. The analysis includes the following steps:

âœ… Dataset Overview: Loading and analyzing both original and synthetically generated datasets.

âœ… Feature Distribution Comparison:

1-Numerical Features: Using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) plots to compare the distributions of real and synthetic data.

2-Categorical Features: Visualizing category proportions in both datasets.

âœ… Correlation Analysis: Comparing feature relationships using correlation heatmaps for both datasets.

âœ… Statistical Summary: Generating descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, etc.) to assess overall consistency.

ðŸ“Š Objective: Ensuring that the augmented dataset maintains statistical similarity with the original data, making it suitable for training machine learning models.
