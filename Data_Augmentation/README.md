Data_Augmentation 

This folder contains data augmentation techniques used to enhance the dataset and improve model generalization. The following methods were applied:

✅ Gaussian Noise Augmentation: Adding Gaussian noise (mean = 0, std = 0.2) to numerical features to increase variability and prevent overfitting.

✅ Handling Missing Values: Imputing missing values using mean, median, or mode, or removing incomplete records if necessary.

✅ Feature Scaling: Standardizing numerical features to ensure consistency across different scales.

✅ Encoding Categorical Features: Using Label Encoding to convert categorical variables into numerical values.

✅ Class Imbalance Handling: Applying SMOTE and Gaussian noise augmentation to balance underrepresented classes.

These preprocessing steps ensure data quality and enhance the model’s ability to learn effectively.
