Top 3 Models with 4 Selected Features 

This folder contains the implementation of the top 3 machine learning models, trained on the 4 most important features, after consulting with a medical expert and analyzing model performance. Additionally, Class 4 (final stage) was removed based on expert recommendations.

üîç Feature Selection Process

Following expert consultation and model evaluation, the 4 most medically and scientifically significant features were selected:

BMI

Triglycerides

Fasting Blood Glucose

Ferritin

The decision to focus on these four features ensures that the model is both clinically relevant and computationally efficient.

üèÜ Top 3 Selected Models

The three best-performing models from the previous phase were retrained using only these 4 key features, with Class 4 removed:

‚úî MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)

‚úî XGBoost-SVM (Hybrid of XGBoost and Support Vector Machine)

‚úî Random Forest

These modifications help in optimizing the model‚Äôs diagnostic accuracy and interpretability while ensuring that predictions remain aligned with medical expertise.
